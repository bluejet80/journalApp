This feeling seems to him like the discovery of a world that can be known, like the first hint of what  may be revealed to him one day.","Poets think, and their thought lives in their works, which are addressed to everyone. Every surface is also a cloak, The first step of any journey almost always involves a fall, a decline, a deconstruction.

It's banal cries for a singular answer, a conclusive result. Forever failing to attempt to place the universe in a box. Your pathetic actions cause deceit for that which is more pure. And so your goal becomes to sabotage and complicate, misconstrue and ill translate the world around you. And you expect me to take you seriously when you shout with confidence and point your finger in the direction of the truth having not even opened your eyes yet.","Geek Love by Kathrine Dunn"],"category":["1.13","2.0","2.20","3.1","3.4","3.5","4.2","4.8","4.11","4.30"]},{"id":2,"journal_name":"Bicycle Sculpture Journal","date":"3/1/10","page_num":11,"text":["The one thing that has the power to shake me to the core. To tear down my optimistic ambitions and ready myself for destruction. To cause me to give up and long to pass away. What an evil thing this must be, to cause those thoughts within me. The foundation of my life turns to fodder. Day and night, night and day. I must hide the way I feel. I cannot act in accordance with the misery that rules my soul.","So at one moment I am by myself, the friend of depression. The next I am interacting as the carefree man, full of as much fake happiness that I can muster up. I don't understand and will most likely never understand. The ruthless deliverer of sadness that seems to have control, and at a moment in my life when I feel that I should be happy and content. What comes so easily is so contrary to what is reasonable. My laziness wishes for it all to be over, to sigh one last time and never open my eyes again. ","But I know that it is my destiny to suffer and sacrifice. There is so little that is given in the world today that I have been chosen to martyr myself, my love, my affection. Oh that my heart would die, so that I then, emotionless might continue without any further pain.
